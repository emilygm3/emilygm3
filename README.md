## Hi there! 👋

I'm Emily (she/her), a second year Data Science and Behavioral Neuroscience major at Northeastern! I'm interested in AI and ML, and I love exploring the interdisciplinary nature of data science. When I'm not coding, you can find me talking about my dog🐶 or finding my new favorite matcha🍵 spot!

## Projects
Spring 2025: My team and I built a full-stack web app to streamline flight logistics for various entities. Check out the repo [here](https://github.com/abby-stevenson/AltitudeAnalysts)!

Summer 2025: My team and I are currently developing a full-stack web application to analyze party loyalty in the European Parliament. Check out the repo [here](https://github.com/siennaboos/PartyLoyaltyProject)!

We are also creating a blog to document our time abroad. The repo can be found [here](https://github.com/alexangione419/BelgianBloggers)!
