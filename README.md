## Hi there! 👋

I'm Emily (she/her), a second year Data Science and Behavioral Neuroscience major at Northeastern! I'm interested in AI and ML, and I love exploring the interdisciplinary nature of data science. When I'm not coding, you can find me talking about my dog🐶 or finding my new favorite matcha🍵 spot!

## Projects
My team and I built a full-stack web app for a final project during the Spring 2025 semester. Check out the repo [here](https://github.com/abby-stevenson/AltitudeAnalysts)!
